Description
This project addresses an issue encountered while interacting with the Amazon website. Specifically, when clicking on a product, the website behaves differently from a regular browser. Instead of opening the product in a new tab, it opens on the same page and refreshes, preventing the "buy now" button from being clicked. As a result, two methods in the code fail.

Try to search config.properties and add your vaild mail, passaword and upi id. 
Try to run test cases/ code review that's available under src/test/com.inetbanking.testcases.
